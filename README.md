# UE5 Training Ground

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my exploration into Unreal Engine 5.3.2. The project's genesis was a blank slate, providing an unbounded canvas to experiment with C++ classes and Blueprints within the Unreal Engine environment.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project were to:
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of Unreal Engine 5's capabilities.
- Develop proficiency in integrating C++ classes and UE5 Blueprint system.
- Experiment with various UE5 features to build a foundational knowledge base for future game development projects.

This project was lately corrupted and can't build with the full features. The source files still serves as good examples of how I could implement different features in UE5.
